## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its physical characteristics.

## Problem Statement
Incorrect predictions could lead to serious health risks if poisonous mushrooms are misclassified as edible. Therefore, we aim to achieve a high level of accuracy and reliability in our model.

## Success Criteria
- **Model Performance**: Achieve an accuracy of at least 80%.
- **Practicality**: The model should be easy to interpret and explain to non-technical stakeholders.

## Constraints
- Limited dataset from Kaggle and UCI.
- Must operate within a reasonable time frame for data processing and model prediction.
