## Model Selection
- Experiment with various classification algorithms:
    - Classification Tree
    - Logistic Regression
    - K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - Neural Network
    - XGBost
    - Random Forest
    - Gradient Boosting

## Model Training
- Train each model using cross-validation to optimize performance.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning for the best model 3 models.
- Save the best model for each of the 3 algorithms chosen before.
- Save the best overall model for deployment.

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Measure of correctly predicted instances.
- **ROC-AUC**: Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.
- **F1 Score**: Balances precision and recall, especially useful for imbalanced classes.
- **Recall**: For poisonous class. Measure of actual positive instances that were correctly predicted.

## Model Results
- Summary of each model's performance on training and validation sets.
