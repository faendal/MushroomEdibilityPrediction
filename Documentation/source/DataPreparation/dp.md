# Data Preparation

## Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values by imputing or dropping rows.
- Convert categorical variables to numeric representations for modeling.

## Feature Engineering
- Create new features based on domain knowledge (e.g., cap-to-stalk ratio).

## Data Transformation
- Encode categorical features using one-hot encoding.
- Standardize or normalize features if necessary.

## Final Dataset
After cleaning and preprocessing, we have a dataset ready for modeling with the following columns:
- Features: `cap-shape`, `cap-color`, `gill-size`, `gill-color`, ...
- Target: `edibility`
